    "description": "The amulet of nature allows players to bind it to a farming patch regardless of it's state (diseased, dead or even empty). The amulet can be used to contact gardeners remotely or teleport directly to the attended patch.\n\n⬥ As of 30 October 2023, removed the dialogue from the Nature Amulet Teleport when right-clicking the teleport option.\n\n⬥ Note that the amulet of nature gets bound to the tile you are standing on when using the amulet on the selected patch.\n\n For in-depth information, [click here](<https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1128455408894353418>)",
