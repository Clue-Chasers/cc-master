    "description": "The 'clue capacity removal' was initially known as the 'clue capacity upgrade', which doubled the soft cap for each clue type from 25 to 50 (excluding master clues, which are always uncapped).\n\n**As of January 20th, 2025**, the previous upgrade cap has been replaced with the purchase of the clue capacity removal for 750 points in the Treasure Trails Reward Shop.\n\nThis means that players who previously purchased the clue capacity upgrade won't need to buy it again, as the effect is now automatically unlocked. As a result, **owning the upgrade grants you the ability to collect an unlimited number of clues**.\n\n For in-depth information, check out: **[What's soft cap?](<https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1024690532682829905>)**",
