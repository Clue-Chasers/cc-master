:treasure_trail_points: Introduction :treasure_trail_points:
This guide is intended for early-ish game Mainscape and Iron players so that they can do their easy clues/downgrade higher tiers to easy clues without losing out on potential loot due to being at the clue cap.
The requirements are an agreed minimum but if you do not have a certain requirement, such as Iron Crafting requirements for jewellery, then complete the clue to the best of your ability using alternative methods. If a clue step cannot be completed and the requirement is too far away, you can choose to destroy the Easy clue. This does not reset your progress on the clue.
Another option for early fortunates (if that is your main goal) is to try focus on maxing out the 001-006 Penguin Agents that spawn randomly in the world (https://runescape.wiki/w/Penguin_Hide_and_Seek#Agents_001-006) and doing weekly penguins to get 007 Agent spawns.
The most accessible location for 001-006 penguins in the early game is War’s Retreat/The Arc, however do note that world hopping to hunt for these penguins could be a tedious process that takes many hours, examples are Maikeru taking 7 hrs for 1 batch of 10 and 4 hours for another batch of 10.
