The Hall of Fame had its origins in a few Discord messages. With the release of the clue scroll rework in 2018, more players became interested in clue scrolls, leading to a growing demand for data. In response, <@139154903623794688> created a comprehensive spreadsheet. The sheet includes tabs for individuals with golden titles, those with one item left, a broadcast leaderboard, notable casket stacks, double broadcasts, OSH procs, probability graphs for golden titles, and more. For additional details, please check the sheet using the following link:
