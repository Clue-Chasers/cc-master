## Hall of Fame Spreadsheet
⬥ **[Click here](<https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A4bBEV4uYEhjM2oXgXBoPNkzb4Z1aQ2iXxSJB7sau9k/edit#gid=51114548>)**

The Hall of Fame began with Discord messages. When the [Clue Scroll Overhaul](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Update:Clue_Scroll_Overhaul_-_Lightning_Weapons>) happened in 2018, more players started doing clue scrolls, and there was a need to gather all their data in one place. <@&336568187552530434> created a detailed spreadsheet covering people with golden clue titles, a treasure trail points leaderboard, an overall and detailed broadcast leaderboard, accomplishments, golden title progress for those with 1 item off, double broadcasts and OSH procs, title averages, probabilities, and more. For more info, check the sheet below.
