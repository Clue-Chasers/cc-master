        "value": "‚¨• We‚Äôve successfully hosted these mass events so far, and we‚Äôre eager to keep that momentum going. While it‚Äôs natural for some friction to arise between groups, we encourage everyone to resolve disagreements privately rather than bringing them into the spotlight during our events.\n\n‚¨• Our events are open to anyone, and it‚Äôs wonderful to see so many people enjoying themselves and connecting from various backgrounds, creating an amazing atmosphere.\n\n‚¨•We want to ensure that no individual or community feels excluded or overwhelmed by larger ones, as that goes against the spirit of our events. If you notice anything during the event that makes you uncomfortable, please don‚Äôt hesitate to **[reach out to us](<https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1283170720599248938>)**.\n\n‚¨• We‚Äôre committed to addressing any concerns with the relevant parties, as we strongly believe in the power of open communication."
