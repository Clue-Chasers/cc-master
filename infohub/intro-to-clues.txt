### __Introduction__
.
In RuneScape there are many distinct archetypes. Clue Scrolls, what began years ago as a simple Distraction and Diversion has since evolved into a niche yet active playstyle for many players. Although the content may initially seem daunting and overwhelming, our community is dedicated to making it more approachable and less intimidating.

### __Key Tips & Essentials__
Becoming proficient with clue scrolls requires mastering several key factors, including knowing where to go and how to navigate efficiently. This is especially challenging for beginners due to the hundreds of locations and steps across various tiers. That's where the Alt1Toolkit comes in. This third-party program helps by providing an overlay on your screen, showing you exactly what to do and greatly reducing the need to memorize locations and routes.

### __Permanent Unlocks__ (TODO)
#### Hidey holes
Easy, medium, hard, and master clues often include [emote clues](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_Trails/Guide/Emotes>), which require you to equip specific items in certain locations and perform an emote. Hidey-holes are storage units that can be used to keep these items for emote steps. Before using them, hidey-holes must be built and are typically located near relevant sites.

For example, in a hard clue step, the Shilo Village bank offers a site to build a hidey-hole. You can use this hidey-hole to store items like the splitbark helm, mud pie, and rune platebody. This way, when you encounter this clue step again, you can retrieve the items from the hidey-hole rather than fetching them from your bank.
