__**Introduction**__
.tag:intro
Clue Trainer is a new clue solver plugin for Alt1 developed by fellow clue chaser <@338283681120780288>.
Originally started under the name "Scan Trainer" and intended to be just an interactive guide for efficient strategies for scan clues, Clue Trainer has evolved into a fully featured clue solver and assistant for Alt1. It has several advantages over Alt1's included clue solver tool. Some highlights include:

- Improved puzzle solver producing fewer steps and updating the overlay in real time according to your actual solving speed.
- Efficient movement suggestions shown directly on the map.
- Advanced strategies for scan clues displayed in an interactive, easy to memorize fashion.
- A compass solver more accurate than ever with the ability to preselect triangulation strategies.
- Real time overlay updating for celtic knots, lockboxes and tower.
- A path and method editor so you can create, save, and share your own ways of solving clues.

Clue Trainer is highly customizable so you can adjust it to your individual needs.

**⬥ Why do my customized Passages of the abyss don't show?**
You are probably missing a setup step. Below the settings for passages of the abyss there is a section used to setup presets for teleport settings. You need to activate your passages in the presets they belong to.
The reasoning behind this feature is to also support the use case of having more than 2 passages for different clue tiers without having to change the settings everytime you switch clue tiers.

**⬥ Can I be notified of significant updates?**
You can sign up for the Clue Trainer role at <id:customize> to get notified about updates.

**⬥ Can I customize how close the map is zoomed after it detects a clue? It's zooming in too close/not close enough?**
Currently, the zooming behaviour is a little wonky. We are aware of the issue and there are plans to improve this.

Clue Trainer includes interactive tools to edit paths for clues (as well as independent from clues). It includes data about teleports and other methods of transportation and ingame collision data. You can check and analyze your paths without having to tediously check them ingame. Check out the "Methods" and "Paths" tab in your browser to get started.
