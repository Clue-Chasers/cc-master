.tag:concept
**Treasure Trails** is a [members](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Members>)-only [Distraction and Diversion](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Distraction_and_Diversion>) <:DnD_icon:1152352409868320848> in which players follow a series of clues leading towards buried treasure.
A Treasure Trail is started by finding a [sealed clue scroll](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Sealed_clue_scroll>), which may be dropped by [various monsters](<https://discord.com/channels/332595657363685377/1023016130077532300>), [pickpocketed](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Thieving>) from [H.A.M. Members](<https://runescape.wiki/w/H.A.M._Member>) <:hammember:1097515692154167417> and [elven clan workers](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Elven_clan_worker>), received from a [treasure chest decoration](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Treasure_chest_decoration>) in an aquarium, killing the skeletal horror, purchased with [thaler](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Thaler>), obtained from the [Prosper](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Prosper>) <:Prosper:1152352942326829157> perk, training [gathering skills](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Gathering_skills>) or collecting [catalysts of alteration](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Catalyst_of_alteration>).<:catalystofalteration:1127677641466597537> The chances of receiing a clue scroll increase with the appropriate tier [luck](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Luck>) enhancer. <:lotd:566453486913323042>
.
As of the [clue scroll overhaul](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Update:Clue_Scroll_Overhaul_-_Lightning_Weapons>) on 26 February 2018, players can collect as many as 25 clue scrolls of each type of difficulty below master, subject to a [soft cap](<https://runescape.wiki/w/Soft_cap>). This can be increased to 50 of each type with 750 Treasure Trail Points at the Treasure Trails Reward Shop. The caps count both sealed and active clue scrolls.
.
Master clues <:Master:1019920500807450666> are unlimited. Originally, players could only have one clue scroll at a time (and reward caskets <:Mastercasket:690876868814962740>) which was later changed to one of all difficulties, and now in its current state. This soft cap can be partially bypassed, such as guaranteed or item holding services. Once the player hits the soft cap however, players cannot obtain any more clue scrolls, outside of guaranteed sources. <:scriptureofbik:892342109791735848> | <:Prosper:1152352942326829157> | <:trisk:643215216934518815> | etc.
.
Only one of each type of sealed clue scroll can be open at a time. Attempting to open a sealed clue scroll if a player already owns an open one will result in the following text in the chat window: You already have an active easy/medium/hard/elite treasure trail. You'll need to either complete or destroy that before starting another.
.
Most unique rewards can be placed in the treasure chest in the costume room of a player-owned house. After completing a Treasure Trail, a message comes up in the chat box indicating how many Treasure Trails have been completed of that difficulty: " Congratulations! You have now completed [amount] [difficulty] treasure trails." The next line tells how many Treasure Trail Points have been obtained: " You earn [amount] treasure trails points. You now have [amount] points."
.
South-west of the Grand exchange's southern gate, a treasure trail expert named Zaida has set up the Treasure Trails Reward Shop with her pack yak, Nigel. Besides offering assistance and information to fellow treasure seekers, she maintains a Treasure Trail information board. There is also a stack of Treasure Trail collection log books behind her for players to use.

.tag:difficulty
The "level" or "tier" of a clue scroll relates to its difficulty. There are five levels of clue scrolls: easy <:Easy:633728862039179294>, medium <:Medium:633728704438075435>, hard <:Hard:633728361918758930>, elite <:Elite:633732493228638209> and master. <:Master:1019920500807450666>
.
An easy clue <:Easy:633728862039179294> is the lowest difficulty treasure trail, with the lowest reward yield. Medium clue scrolls <:Medium:633728704438075435> are a medium difficulty treasure trail with a more substantial reward yield. Hard clue scrolls <:Hard:633728361918758930> are a more hazardous treasure trail, but can be very rewarding. Elite clue scrolls are much harder to obtain and can be very dangerous <:Elite:633732493228638209> (both to receive and to complete). Master clue scrolls <:Master:1019920500807450666> have the greatest difficulties in obtaining and the highest requirements for completing, but offer the greatest rewards and are generally considered to be significantly easier than elites.

As monster drops, clue scrolls are always considered "tertiary" (bonus drop); luck can affect the chances of one rolling. When received, a loot beam will always appear and a game message will tell the player of the drop. As skilling drops, clue scrolls can be obtained at random and a game message will inform the player whenever they obtain one.

If the player cannot complete the clue, then it is recommended to exchange it for another with the Globetrotter backpack <:globetrotterbackpack:1123592248056102993> (if available), or destroy it. Some clues (notably emote clues) may also be skipped with a Skipping ticket <:costumeskipticket:1123590734507954215>, although this may not be cost-effective. Zaida can also exchange the clue scroll for a lower difficulty if needed, though she will not convert any easy clue scrolls <:Easy:633728862039179294> as they are the lowest tier.

Sealed clue scrolls can also be obtained by training gathering skills. Skills that can yield clues are Archaeology <:archaeology:941211288665739274>, Divination <:divination:1042453694735712286> (1/2,500 chance), Fishing <:fishing:892342109938540564> (1/3,000 chance), Mining <:mining:1014248188770787390> (1/2,250 chance), and Woodcutting <:woodcutting:1014248186782699541> (1/3,000 chance).
.
The tier of clue scroll players receive is weighted based on their level of the activity, with elites appearing at level 60 training methods and above.
