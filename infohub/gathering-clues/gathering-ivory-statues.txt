### Introduction *(courtesy of <@299098494671519745>)*
Medium clues <:mediumclue:1123586948905324637> are fast to gather and solve. They have the third highest master clue scroll <:Master:1019920500807450666> and have a Fortunate component <:fortunatecomp:583435543845797891> rate of 53/100, note that this rate does include re-rolls and tier 4 luck <:lotd:566453486913323042>.

This guide provides a method for AFKing Ivory Statues for Medium clues <:mediumclue:1123586948905324637>. Using Dwarf Weed Incense <:dwarfincense:1333016299055484998> yields an average of ~4 Medium clues <:mediumclue:1123586948905324637>. A Legendary pet familiar can also pick up sealed clues, though the amount is entirely RNG-based and cannot be reliably predicted.
.
Short AFK can be done a few ways:
⬥ Actively hunting down the escaped ivory statues for them to reset
⬥ Killing the escaped ivory statues each hour
⬥ Both will be actively picking up Medium clues <:mediumclue:1123586948905324637> when they drop and of course repotting.

### Location and How to Get there

.
### Setup
In order to AFK Ivory Statues efficiently you must place your cannon <:cannon:869283142350041098> then kill all the Ivory Statues to reset them.
Here is a guide displaying the setup:

If you are opting to use an alt to gain the 10-20% increase in kills per hour, you can also use the alt to kill escaped Ivory Statues (rare):
⬥ Position your alts oldak coil <:oldakcoil:798285651387613194> on the designated yellow tile, as shown below, precisely two tiles north east of the far east patch. As for your alts position it should stand on the designated red tile, hugging the west wall at the top.
