To bind the amulet of nature the player must use the amulet on the diseased patch they desire but this can only be bound to one patch at a time, and will remain bound until a different patch is used. Unlike the amulet of farming, it can be bound to any type of farming patch.

Note that the amulet of nature gets bound to the tile you are standing on when using the amulet on the the diseased patch.
