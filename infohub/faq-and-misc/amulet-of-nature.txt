The amulet of nature <:amuletofnature:1123599470911815750> allows players to bind it to a farming patch regardless of it's state (diseased, dead or even empty). The amulet can be used to contact gardeners remotely or teleport directly to the attended patch.

*Note: that the amulet of nature gets bound to the tile you are standing on when using the amulet on the selected patch.*

*Update: As of 30 October 2023, removed the dialogue from the Nature Amulet Teleport when right-clicking the teleport option.*
