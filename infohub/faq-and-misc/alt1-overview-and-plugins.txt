Unlike OSRS which has the RuneLite client, RS3 only has its NXT client. In order to add some extra QoL/features, the Alt1 Toolkit was developed by <@107515476296368128>. This channel serves as a brief overview about Alt1 and what it's used for in regards to Clue Scrolls with some extra helpful add-ons/plugins developed for it.

> __**Alt1 Overview**__
.tag:alt1
⬥ Alt1 is a 3rd-party program that consists of several application overlays on your screen.
⬥ They get information by reading your screen, and provide a bunch of QoL/useful features.

.
> __**How It Works**__
⬥ Alt1 is designed to capture images of the NXT Client and parse them with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Library.
⬥ The captured data is then transformed into pixel data that can be used in Alt1 apps.
⬥ More information can be found on the forums and in the Alt1 Toolkit discord.

.
> __**Is It Safe?**__
⬥ Alt1 is essentially a glorified Chromium browser that creates overlays over your game. Every Alt1 app is essentially a webpage.
⬥ Alt1 does not send any inputs or otherwise directly interact with your client beyond reading the pixels on the screen.
⬥ **It is not a client, therefore you won't get banned for using it.** https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/3ovux7/the_alt1_toolkit_has_been_reviewed_by_jagex_and/

.
> __**Clue Solver**__
.tag:cluesolver
⬥ This is a very useful app that looks at your currently open clue on screen, and tells you how to solve it.
⬥ It handles every type of clue except for scans which are explained through the <#1123544061052207114>
⬥ Have your clue visible on-screen clearly and click the 'Unlock Any' button to find a solution to your clue that will be displayed on the overlay.

> __**3rd-Party Alt1 Apps**__
.tag:apps
In addition to the default apps that come with Alt1, there are a number of other useful third-party apps that can be installed.

⬥ Alt1 Addons can be installed by going to the correct URL in either your normal browser or the Alt1 in-built browser.
⬥ This will bring up a prompt to add the application to Alt1.
⬥ The list of apps below have the full URL following each one.
⬥ Note that none of these links will work on mobile, as they require Alt1 to be installed.
