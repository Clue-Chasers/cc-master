1) Have you purchased the Clue Cap Removal upgrade? If not, remember that the default clue cap is set at 25 clues per tier with the exception of master clues. This cap becomes unlimited once the upgrade is acquired. 
2) Make sure to also check your bank, inventory, and clue carrier to see if youâ€™re below the initial soft cap. Additionally the cap is based on the sum of each clue tier separately. Unfinished clues count towards the cap.
3) If you are pickpocketing H.A.M. members, make sure you have you completed "(Lost Her Marbles miniquest)[<https://runescape.wiki/w/Lost_Her_Marbles_(miniquest)>]".
