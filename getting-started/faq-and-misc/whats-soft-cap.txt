A soft cap is a type of limit placed on a quantity of something in RuneScape. Unlike a hard cap, which places an unavoidable limit on the quantity, soft caps allow players to go over defined limits, but with extra restrictions placed on the excess. The restriction placed varies based on the applied soft cap.

Clue scrolls: there is a soft cap of 25 (50 with the clue capacity upgrade) clues per clue difficulty, except for sealed master clue scrolls, which have no cap. However, players can receive over 25 clues of a certain difficulty if that clue scroll is received from a guaranteed source, such as the treasure chest decoration guaranteeing a sealed elite clue scroll each time it is opened. Additionally, the Prosper perk allows players to obtain clue scrolls above the cap, and clue scrolls obtained from harvesting a Sacred yak bypass the cap.
