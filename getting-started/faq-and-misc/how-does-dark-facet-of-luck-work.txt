__A 1% chance to skip a clue step on completion of a clue step.__
When the ring shines to skip a clue step, the following message appears in the chat box:
The Dark Facet of Luck used Forbidden knowledge to allow you to skip a clue step.

__0.1% chance to gain two caskets on completion of a clue scroll.__
When the ring shines to double a casket, the player will receive a pop-up chatbox stating: You've found a casket! The Dark Facet of Luck forms a second casket in its shadow. A message stating that the player received 2x caskets will also appear in the unfiltered game chat.

__Additional teleport to the Dwarven Outpost, only when the player is using the equipment.__
The effects of the enchantment are permanently applied to the player once used.
