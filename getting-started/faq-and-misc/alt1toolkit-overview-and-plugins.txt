Unlike OSRS which has the RuneLite client, RS3 only has its NXT client. In order to add some extra QoL/features, the Alt1 Toolkit was developed by <@107515476296368128> This channel serves as a brief overview about Alt1 and what it's used for in regards to Clue Scrolls with some extra helpful add-ons/plugins developed for it.

### > __**Alt1 Overview**__
.tag:alt1
⬥ Alt1 is a 3rd-party program that consists of several application overlays on your screen.
⬥ They get information by reading your screen, and provide a bunch of QoL/useful features.

.
### > __**How It Works**__
⬥ Alt1 is designed to capture images of the NXT Client and parse them with an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) Library.
⬥ The captured data is then transformed into pixel data that can be used in Alt1 apps.
⬥ More information can be found on the forums and in the Alt1 Toolkit discord.

.
### > __**Is It Safe?**__
⬥ Alt1 is essentially a glorified Chromium browser that creates overlays over your game. Every Alt1 app is essentially a webpage.
⬥ Alt1 does not send any inputs or otherwise directly interact with your client beyond reading the pixels on the screen.
⬥ **[Since it's not a client, there's no risk of being banned for its use.](<https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/3ovux7/the_alt1_toolkit_has_been_reviewed_by_jagex_and/>)**

.
### > __**Standard Clue Solver**__
.tag:cluesolver
⬥ This is a very useful app that looks at your currently open clue on screen, and tells you how to solve it.
⬥ To utilize the app, ensure your clue is clearly visible on-screen, not overlapping with other interfaces and simply click the **'Unlock Any'** button to access a solution displayed on the overlay.
⬥ Here's a handy tip: Simply press the lock icon in the top-left corner to instantly display the solution for the next clue.

### > __**3rd-Party Alt1 Apps**__
.tag:apps
In addition to the default apps that come with Alt1, there are a number of other useful third-party apps that can be installed.

⬥ Alt1 Addons can be installed by going to the correct URL in either your normal browser or the Alt1 in-built browser.
⬥ This will bring up a prompt to add the application to Alt1.
⬥ The list of apps below have the full URL following each one.
⬥ Note that none of these links will work on mobile, as they require Alt1 to be installed.
.
### > __**Linux and macOS Support**__
.tag:linuxmac
While official Alt1 support is not offered for these operating systems, there's an alternative plugin designed for macOS called [RuneKit](https://github.com/whs/runekit), which you might find beneficial to explore.

**Important Notes** - Both in-game time stamps and the app above use your local machine time. For most people it's off from RuneScape's internal server time by +/- 2 seconds.
⬥ The few seconds can be corrected like this:

.
**Requirements and recommendations for Clue Split Timer:**
⬥ Timestamps on in chat - it's how the app tracks clue times.
⬥ Interface transparency off, for best chatbox reading accuracy.
⬥ 12 point font size in chat, because alt1 is known to misread messages more often on other font sizes.
⬥ Make sure your chatbox is of suitable width so the app can easily read all the correct messages.
⬥ Turn off/Disable the Legacy Interface option. It messes up Alt1s ability to read the chat box.
.
### > __**Catalyst Tracker**__ - `alt1://addapp/https://ibbykay.github.io/CatalystClueTracker/appconfig.json`
.tag:catalyst
**Explanation** - tracks clues from Catalyst of alterations displayed in the chat window.
